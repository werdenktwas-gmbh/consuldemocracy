# Communication

The preferred way to report any missing piece of information is [opening an issue in the project's Github repo](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/docs/issues/new).

Before doing it, **please take some time to check the [existing issues](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/consuldemocracy/issues) and make sure what you are about to report isn't already reported** by another person. In case someone else reported the same problem before or a similar one, and you have more details about it, you can write a comment in the issue page. A little more help can make a huge difference!

In order to write a new issue, take into account these few tips to make it easy to read and comprehend:

- Try to use a descriptive and to-the-point title.
- It's a good idea to include some sections -in case they're needed- such as: steps to reproduce the bug, expected behaviour/response, actual response or screenshots.
- Also it could be helpful to provide your operating system, browser version and installed plugins.

On the other hand, if you need a space for more informal and open interaction, we have the [Discussions](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/consuldemocracy/discussions) section. It's similar to a discussion forum within the project, where you can ask questions, make suggestions, share ideas, and have conversations that don't necessarily fit into an issue or pull request.
