# Configure your fork

## Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a tool integrated into GitHub that allows you to automate tasks such as running tests every time you make a change to your code. Since Consul Democracy already includes predefined configurations for GitHub Actions, enabling continuous integration in your fork is very straightforward.

### Steps to enable GitHub Actions

1. **Enable GitHub Actions in your fork**:
   1. Once you have created the fork, go to the "**Actions**" tab in your GitHub repository.
   1. You will see a message that says: "Workflows arenâ€™t being run on this forked repository." This is normal because GitHub disables workflows by default in newly forked repositories for security reasons.
   1. Click the "**I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**" button to enable workflows in your fork.

2. **Verify the configuration**:
   1. Make a change to any project file (for example, edit a `.md` file) in a branch other than master and push it to your fork.
   1. Open a pull request from the new branch to master in your fork.
   1. Go to the "**Actions**" tab and verify that the tests are running correctly based on the workflows defined in the project's `.github/workflows/` directory.
